Vaccines work by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against specific pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc.), providing immunity without causing the disease.

Before widespread vaccination, diseases like polio, measles, and whooping cough were common causes of death and disability, particularly among children.\n",

A high vaccination rate makes it difficult for the disease to spread, safeguarding vulnerable populations.\n",
